# DigitalTwin of Production Process
I did a digital twin application project aimed at digitising a production process. I wrote this project in C# based on object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and designed both server and client applications using the Windows Forms application. 
Server App include billetform.cs,kutuk_s覺n覺f.cs,kullan覺c覺formu.cs,frmyonlendirme.cs,istatistikler.cs ...
Also this application was developed on Visual Studio 2022 platform with C# language.
